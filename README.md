## PROJECT OBJECTIVE

### Areas of Concern:
- Salesperson Performance  
- Sales by Country  
- Sales by Age  
- Sales by Gender  
- Sales by Boxes Shipped  
- Sales Trend Report  
- Sales by Product

## IN-ANALYSIS  

1. **Top Salesperson:** Kelci Walkden – 54 boxes  
2. **Least Salesperson:** Curtis Avani – 46 boxes  
3. **Top Country:** Australia – 205 boxes  
4. **Lowest Country:** New Zealand – 173 boxes  
5. **Top Month:** June – 163 boxes  
6. **Lowest Month:** (Not Named) – 110 boxes  
7. **Top Age Group:** 50-59  
8. **Lowest Age Group:** 80-89  
9. **Top Product:** 50% Dark Site – 60 boxes  

## RECOMMENDATION  

1. Curtis should attend sales and customer retention training.  
2. Replicate June’s strategy for months with lower sales.  
3. Transfer knowledge from Australia's salesperson to New Zealand.  
4. Bundle high-performing products (50% Dark Site, Eclairs) with lower-selling items (85% Dark Bars, After Nines, Fruits & Nuts Bar).  

## POST-ANALYSIS  

1. 50% Dark Site & Eclairs = 60 boxes each; 85% Dark Bars, After Nines, Fruits & Nuts = 50 boxes each.  
2. "85% Dark Bars" had a 25% sales increase in Q1 YoY; online sales are increasing.  
3. Use 50% Dark Site and Eclairs as hooks to promote lesser-selling items with beverages.  
4. Confirmed seasonal sales trends; unexpected strong segments call for deeper regional marketing research.

## This analysis serves as a strategic guide to boost chocolate sales, identify market patterns, and enhance team performance across locations.
